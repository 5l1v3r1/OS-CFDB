# Technical Information

## Description 
The assessment team was able to use successfully custom-tailored e-mail correspondence embedded with links and files designed to entice a user to interact with malicious content. These messages often include malicious links to payloads that are crafted as well. These types of attacks have historically been effective because they exploit human nature into trusting the attacker. These types of attacks can range in sophistication and motivation of the attacker. 

## Impact
When a phishing email can subvert NSM and AESP (Advanced Endpoint Security Protection), an attacker can then reach their intended target. These e-mails can result in malicious code being run on the remote host and additional network compromise. 

## Recommendation(s)
Reduce user spear phishing susceptibility through increased spear phishing awareness training and testing of employees. It also recommended conducting this training quarterly.
