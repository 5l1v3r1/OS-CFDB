# Technical Information

## Description 
The strength of a password policy is a combination of length, complexity, and predictability. Failure to implement a strong password may result in unauthorized access to a system or application.  A strong password policy can protect an organization from brute-force password cracking, guessing, and reuse.

## Impact
If a strong password policy is absent, reverse brute-force and password guessing attacks can take place. These attacks can lead to further system compromise of domain access in a unauthenticated scenario.

## Recommendation(s)
Enforce password policy on all systems by applicable industry best practices, and company-defined requirements. Corporate password policy should be enforced via GPO (Group Policy Objects).
