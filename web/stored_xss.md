# Technical Information

### Description 
 A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website and can therefore compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between the website and client. Websites are vulnerable if they display user supplied data from requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable. 
### Impact
If an attacker can gain access to the domain environment, they effectively can use these gathered credentials to attempt privilege escalation. These "User" credentials could result in further lateral movement or the ability to gain unauthorized access to different regions within the domain.

### Recommendation(s)
The assessment team recommends that scripts used for administration, password changes, authenticated share mounting be removed. Automated password changes and authenticated share mounting should be accomplished with proper AD group delegation. A thorough audit should be conducted domain wide to identify other scripts exposing sensitive data or credentials.
